# ClockworkLeyline1
Translation mod for Nintendo Switch version of A Clockwork Leyline Trilogy.

It translates only first game, Ushio route was not tested.

Uploading files here only if I will ever need to work with other VN using HuneX engine because I put a lot of work into figuring out how to parse scenario and textures via plugin without repacking them to archives.
Project is dead and won't continue simply because after getting to the Common End of first game it turned out it was so boring I have lost any energy to continue working on it.

Installation:
Compatible only with 1.0.0 version of game. Put `0100983013C9A000` folder to `atmosphere/contents/`, play game.
It is necessary to set `Font 1` in Settings -> Text to properly show dialogues.
